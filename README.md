##Overview
How one part of the brain responds to periodic input from another part depends on resonant circuit
properties. Resonance is a basic property of physical systems, and has been experimentally observed
at various levels of neuronal organization both in vitro and in vivo. Yet how resonance is generated in
neuronal networks is largely unknown. In particular, whether resonance can be generated directly at 
the level of a network of spiking neurons remains to be determined. Using detailed biophysical
modeling, we develop a conceptual framework according to which resonance at a given level of
organization is generated by the interplay of low- and high-pass filters, implemented at either the
same or across levels of neuronal organization. We tease apart representative, biophysically-plausible
generative mechanisms of resonance at four different levels of organization: membrane potential
fluctuations, single neuron spiking, synaptic transmission, and neuronal networks. We identify
conditions under which resonance at one level can be inherited to another level of organization,
provide conclusive evidence that resonance at each level can be generated without resonance at any
other level, and describe a number of representative routes to network resonance. The proposed
framework facilitates the investigation of resonance in neuronal systems.
